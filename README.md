# ChessTestProject
A small project with the sole purpose of practising with Java.

The project consists of creating a chess game with the Java programming language. A tutorial from 'Software Architecture & Design' has been followed step by step (https://www.youtube.com/playlist?list=PLOJzCFLZdG4zk5d-1_ah2B4kqZSeIlWtt),
and the code has been analyzed, edited and commented in order to get a better understanding of its logic and structure.
