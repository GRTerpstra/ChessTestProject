# ChessTestProject
A small project with the sole purpose of practising with Java.
Followed the tutorial from 'Software Architecture & Design' step by step (https://www.youtube.com/playlist?list=PLOJzCFLZdG4zk5d-1_ah2B4kqZSeIlWtt),
and edited, analyzed and commented the code to get a better understanding of the structure.
